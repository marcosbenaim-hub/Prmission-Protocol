# Contributing to the Prmission Protocol

Thanks for your interest in contributing! This project is in confidential draft stage.

## How to get involved

1. Read the docs first - Start with the README for the big picture, then read the Full Protocol Spec in docs/PROTOCOL.md for technical details.
2. Open an issue - Have a question, suggestion, or found something that doesnt make sense? Open a GitHub Issue. No idea is too small.
3. Propose changes - Fork the repo, make your edits on a new branch, and open a Pull Request. Please include a clear description of what you changed and why.

## What we are looking for help with

- Feedback on the protocol rules (Section 3 of the spec) - do they make sense? Are there gaps?
- Regulatory review - especially around GDPR, CCPA, and emerging AI data laws
- SDK design input - what would make this easy to build on?
- Plain-language improvements - help us make the docs clearer for non-technical readers

## Ground rules

- Be respectful and constructive
- When in doubt, ask - open an issue before making large changes
- Keep commits focused - one change per pull request when possible

## Questions?

Open an issue or reach out through the links in the README.
