**Consent-Based Data Exchange for AI Agent Networks**

Interoperability Specification
**Cos-Prmission × OpenClaw × ECCO**

## What is this?

The Prmission Protocol is a set of rules for how **businesses, customers, and AI assistants** share personal data with each other — where **you, the person, are always in control**.

It connects three open-source projects:

- **Cos-Prmission** — The app/interface where you say "yes" or "no" to sharing specific data, and where payments happen. Includes both an SDK (for developers) and a GUI (for everyone else).
- **OpenClaw** — Your personal AI assistant that talks to businesses on your behalf across messaging apps (WhatsApp, Telegram, etc.).
- **ECCO** — The behind-the-scenes network that helps businesses and your AI assistant find each other, negotiate deals, and settle payments.

## The core idea

**No one can collect, use, or share your data without your clear, specific permission — and you can take that permission back at any time.**

Right now, when you shop online, companies quietly collect your data behind the scenes (cookies, trackers, etc.). This protocol flips that model. Every time a business wants something from you — your email, your purchase history, your preferences — they have to **ask you directly**, explain exactly what they want it for, and **pay you for it**.

## Why it matters

This replaces cookie banners and fine-print privacy policies with something better. It is designed to comply with **GDPR** (Europe) and **CCPA** (California) by default, because consent is built into the foundation — not bolted on as an afterthought.
